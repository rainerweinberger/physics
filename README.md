# Physics

Created by Rainer Weinberger, 2020 (rainer.weinberger@cfa.harvard.edu)

This is a small python package that simplifies working with physics equations.

To install library, type

    python setup.py install
    
for the local user (in case you don't have root access):

    python setup.py install --user

Note that the open-close principle and downward comparability will not be enforced.
Rather, the implementations should be as simple as possible, and class hierarchies 
as shallow as possible.
